# Displaying-Letters-Numbers-from-Keypad-on-LCD-using-8051-Microcontroller
This project allows users to enter letters or numbers using a keypad, which are then displayed on an LCD using an 8051 microcontroller. 
# Description
This project allows users to enter letters or numbers using a keypad, which are then displayed on an LCD using an 8051 microcontroller. The keypad serves as the input interface, and each keypress is captured by the microcontroller and shown on the LCD in real-time. The project is programmed in Embedded C and simulated using Proteus, making it easy to visualize the interactions between the keypad, microcontroller, and LCD.This project is an excellent way to learn how to interface both input devices (keypad) and output devices (LCD) with a microcontroller, allowing for dynamic data entry and display.
# Features:
Microcontroller Used: 8051 (AT89C51 or equivalent)
Programming Language: Embedded C
Simulation Software: Proteus
Input Device: 4x4 or 3x4 Keypad
Display Device: 16x2 LCD
# How it Works:
The keypad is connected to the microcontroller's GPIO pins (e.g., P1 port), and each keypress is scanned and interpreted by the microcontroller.
The LCD is connected to another port (e.g., P2) to display the characters.
Each time a key is pressed, the corresponding letter or number is shown on the LCD screen.
Proteus simulation allows for real-time testing, showing the typed characters or numbers as they appear on the LCD.
# Simulation:
Using Proteus, the keypad and LCD interactions are simulated to ensure that each keypress results in the correct display on the LCD, making it possible to test the program without physical hardware.
